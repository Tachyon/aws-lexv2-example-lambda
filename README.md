# Amazon Lex V2 - Lambda Blueprints to work with Example bots 

The Amazon Lex V2 console provides example bots (called bot blueprints) that are preconfigured so you can quickly create and test a bot in the console. Unlike Lex V1, Lex V2 does not provide corresponding Lambda function blueprints. I have taken the Lex V1 Lambda blueprints and modified them to work with Lex v2 Lambda interface. These python scripts can help Lex v2 users play with Lex V2 and Lambda integration. 

These blueprints provide sample code that works with their corresponding bots. You can use these blueprints to quickly create a bot that is configured with a Lambda function as a code hook, and test the end-to-end setup without having to write code.
